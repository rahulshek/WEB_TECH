    <!--This is a hybrid element type which has characteristics of both block and inline elements
    1. The inline block tag takes the space of the whole content rather than taking the whole width of the parent tag
    2. We can change the height and width of an inline block tag
    3. The inline block element will appear next to other inline elements rather than appering in the next line which happens in block tag.
